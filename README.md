## The Gut Bugs Trial

The Gut Bugs Trial was a double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial that assessed the efficacy of fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) to treat adolescent (aged 14-18 years) obesity and improve metabolism. In total, 28 acid-resistant capsules containing gut microbiota from 4 sex-matched donors were administered to the FMT recipients over two consecutive days. Recipients were clinically assessed at baseline, and at 6-, 12-, and 26-weeks post-treatment. Donor and recipient stool samples collected at each clinical assessment underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. In total, 381 metagenomic sequencing files were analysed.

## The FOCUS Trial

The FOCUS Trial was a double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial that assessed the efficacy of FMT to treat adult (aged 18-75 years) ulcerative colitis (UC). FMT from 4-7 donors was administered via an initial colonoscopic infusion, followed by enemas at a frequency of 5 days per week for 8 weeks. Stool samples were obtained from individual donors and donor batches, as well as recipients every 4 weeks during the blinded treatment phase. A subset of 157 metagenomic sequencing files were selected for analysis.

## Donor strain engraftment analysis

This repository contains the following R scripts used to analyse metagenomic data from the Gut Bugs Trial and FOCUS Trial for evidence of donor strain engraftment.
Strain engraftment analysis of the FOCUS Trial was initially performed in a blinded manner.
